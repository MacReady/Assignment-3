XSOB
The game also involves a non-empty words list read from a file. For example, here are example file contents for a list of three words:

ANT
BOX
SOB
TO
The object of the game is for the players to view the board and find words (the words list is unknown to the players). Words may be contained in rows (from left to right) or columns (from top to bottom). When a player correctly guesses a word that occurs in the list of words, that player is awarded points according to a scoring system described below. The game ends when all words from the list of words have been guessed. The player with the highest score wins.

The words from the words list and the letters of the board are made up of alphabetic, uppercase characters.
